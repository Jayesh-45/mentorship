> # **Cloud regions and availability zones**

1. Cloud computing allows users to store large databases and develop complex applications.
2. It also offers several benefits such as- instant scalability, low costs, security, anytime anywhere access, high availability, etc.
3. To store all of this data and manage all these 
4. Region, like the name indicates, is a separate geographic area.
5. Within each region there are multiple, isolated locations: Availability Zones. 
6. AZs have independent power sources, computing, networking, and cooling resources. 
7. Typically, especially if you’re new to the public cloud, your presence will be on a single AZ.

## What is a region?
- The simplest explanation is that a “cloud region” describes the actual, real-life geographic location where your public cloud resources are located.
- Regions allow you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers, both internal or external. 
- The closer your customers are to the region where your cloud resources are located, the faster and better their experience will be.

### How to choose a *region*


- #### Latency

  - Latency is ex. 
    - If you have a low latency connection, there’s little to no lag.
    - But if you have a high latency connection, there's continuous lagging which can be troublesome.
  - If your data center is in Thailand and your customers are in Arizona, they’re going to experience latency simply due to distance.
  - So, the first thing you need to do is determine where most of your customers are and choose a region that’s closest to them.
  - On such basis regions are determined.

- #### Cost

  - It costs money to run data centers, energy costs, and taxes, a cloud region can cost more money in some areas than in others.
  - For instance, a cloud region in the X area may cost more than a cloud region in Y because all those differences in real estate prices.
  - A few cloud region can be less expensive.
  - So a more expensive region will equal higher costs on your pocket.

- #### Compliance and security

  - Every company has different security requirements based on its industry, location, etc. 
  - It’s also important to know what the compliance laws in your country so that you donnt face any difficulty. 

- #### Computing and processor features

  - What’s inside the data center matters as much as where the center is located. 
  - If you require the latest, most up-to-date compute and processing, you would wannt a cloud provider that has the most lastest hardware. 
  - If you really want cutting-edge speed and power, you may need to look for a provider that uses Top-notch processors.

- #### Services and features

  - Services vary region by region. 
  - You’ll notice the difference in features that cloud provides varies widely.
  - Therefore the features and services should be checked as you begin your cloud provider hunt

- #### Disaster recovery

  - Having a down network could cost your business a huge amount of money, so Disaster recovery is important. 
  - Some companies have many data centers in the same region.
  - Regions are also commonly used as part of disaster recovery (DR) strategy
  - Each region is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions. 
  - If a earthquake like disaster hit's AWS’s US any region, say 'west' region, the other regions would be still running.


- **Important points:**
  - A region is not an Availability zone.
  - A region must have at least one AZ within it, but they’re often made up of multiple ones. 
  - For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS)‘s US East region is made up of six availability zones.

> ## Region Pairs:
- Each Region is paired with another region within the same geographical location, and this makes a regional pair.
- These regional pairs are always located greater than 300 miles apart. 
- These Azure Region pairs are directly connected and so far away that any disaster affects only one region.
- If one of the regions experience a disaster, then the services of the primary region will automatically fail, and the secondary region is available as a backup.


## Benefits of paired regions
1. Physical isolation
Each Azure region within a pair is located at least 300 miles apart. This helps in isolation of the pairs so that the regional disaster affects only one region within that pair.

2. Platform-provided replication
There are some services within Microsoft Azure such as Geo-Redundant Storage that provides automatic replication to the paired region.

3. Region recovery order
For maximum disaster recovery, one region out of every pair is prioritized for recovery Out of every pair, the recovery of one region is prioritized.

4. Data residency
A region resides within the same geography for the data residency requirements for tax and judiciary purposes.

5. Sequential updates
To minimize the downtime, the paired regions are sequentially updated.
